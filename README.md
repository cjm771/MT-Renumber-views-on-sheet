Renumber Views On a Sheet by [Chris Malcolm](http://chris-malcolm.com). The annoying part is that in revit, your view number on the sheet does not update magically when you move views around on your invisible cell grid. Furthermore, manually renumbering is sometimes a pain because you occassionally will get a nasty alert message from revit if you attempt to renumber with a duplicate number that already exists...

So this is a tool made a tool (revit python shell or dynamo player) to automatically renumber the views based on the location of the view on the sheet.
